A predictive system built to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The project leverages an imbalanced dataset, applying preprocessing methods such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling class imbalance (SMOTE/undersampling). Various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) are trained and evaluated on metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, with a focus on minimizing false negatives. This project highlights expertise in data preprocessing, model selection, imbalanced classification, and real-world financial fraud prevention.
